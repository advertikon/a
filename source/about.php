            <p>I’m Orly, and all my life, I have been both technologically and artistically inclined. A dichotomy? Well, maybe…. But this fine balance of science and art has always kept me a DIY, crafty kind of girl! </p>

            <p>Getting my bachelor’s degree in theoretical mathematics and electrical engineering really fueled my desire to constantly challenge myself.  Therefore, I’ve always felt that I wanted to create a product which fuses the worlds of technology and art. I’m a firm believer in change and development, and living this philosophy supports the all varied interests in my life.</p>
            <p>In my early years, I worked in the food & service industry.  Post degree, I sought employment in High Tech, wherein I specialized in development, operations and production.  After the last 10 intensive (yet fascinating) years, I felt the need to explore new pastimes to find my inner peace and tranquility. I tried dance classes, took boxing lessons, went back packing thru Spain, and even started working for a new company to help make a difference.  I continued on to carpentry & goldsmith’s work, which ultimately exposed me to working with fine metals. Aha! Jewelry!  </p>
            <p>At long last, I discovered a world of art, technique, science and creativity...And then the idea came to me... SCORE!  An idea, which I had been consistently seeking, to integrate my ability in creating a product that really represents me as well as my personal style!</p>
